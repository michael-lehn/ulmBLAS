# ulmBLAS

**A high performance BLAS implementation**

This library is part of my lecture:

**Software Basics for High Performance Computing** (MATH9367)  
Ulm University

And yes, I am particularly proud of the section demonstrating how to achieve
peak performance for the matrix-matrix product:

**Note:** Further development will take place in
[ulmBLAS-core](https://github.com/michael-lehn/ulmBLAS-core).

## Background

The design and implementation of ulmBLAS was strongly inspired by the ideas
presented in:

Field G. Van Zee and Robert A. van de Geijn. *BLIS: A Framework for Rapidly
Instantiating BLAS Functionality.* ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software,
41(3), 14:1â€“14:33, June 2015.
[https://doi.org/10.1145/2764454](https://doi.org/10.1145/2764454)

At the time of the initial development of ulmBLAS (mainly in 2014), I was
referring to a preprint version of this paper:
[https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/pubs/blis1_toms_rev3.pdf](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/pubs/blis1_toms_rev3.pdf)
